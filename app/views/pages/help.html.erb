<ol>
  <li>Planes fly at about 6 miles per minute, so the arrival time and flight duration could, in theory, be calculated rather than stored in the database.</li>
  <li>Every Academy Air flight costs the same: $70.</li>
  <li>We only accept Visa credit cards.  Visa cards are 16-digits numbers that always start with the number 4.</li>
